= Can I customize the look of the popup? =

Yes & No. You can set the look of your popup in your OptiMonk admin area, but there is no option to set it in your WordPress admin area.

= Can I set where will the popup be displayed? =

Yes & No. You can set these options in your OptiMonk admin area, but there is no option to set it in your WordPress admin area.

= Can I have more than one popup on my website? =

Yes, you can have as many popups, as you like. You don't need to set anything else on your website. You can add new popups in your OptiMonk admin area.

= I can't see the popup. Why is it? =

The popup is showing only for non-logged-in users. If you want to test the OptiMonk popup on your website, you have to load it in an incognito window or you have to log out first. This will save you impressions and conversion rate in your statistics. And you actually don't want to see it after you set up everything.
